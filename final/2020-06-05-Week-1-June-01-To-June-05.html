<h2 id="coding-period-started">Coding Period Started</h2>
<p>With the beginning of this month, GSoC Coding Period begins, I started working actively, I also had Video call with my mentor last week &amp; we discussed a lot about this project &amp; program. My mentors suggested me to first work on frontend of App ( Developing UI Screens ) with dummy data &amp; later work on backend.</p>
<h2 id="developing-ui-screens-of-app-with-dummy-data">Developing UI Screens of App with Dummy Data</h2>
<p>This week I made UI screens of App with Dummy Data, I added Navigation Drawer, Bottom Navigation in app. I made UI of each screen. Some screens UI are pending but, I will do it by next week.</p>
<p>I will discuss here each screen I made with Dummy Data for now</p>
<h3 id="1-home-screen">1. Home Screen</h3>
<p>This screen will display nearby hospitals with images, It contains a search bar with settings icon which displays settings to change radius to display nearby hospitals.</p>
<p>I have tried to make search bar similar to Google Play Store Search Bar.</p>

<h3 id="2-search-screen">2. Search Screen</h3>
<p>It contains a search bar by which user can search for any procedure, It displays list of procedures</p>
<h3 id="3-settings-screen">3. Settings Screen</h3>
<p>It displays a slider which can control radius of UI.</p>
<h3 id="4-saved-screens">4. Saved Screens</h3>
<p>It will display list of chargemasters which are saved in local storage as SQL Database of App</p>
<h3 id="5-view-cdm-statewise">5. View CDM Statewise</h3>
<p>User can view CDM of any hospital of any state</p>
<p>I have added Navigation Drawer which contains the following screens</p>
<ul>
<li>View CDM Statewise</li>
<li>Compare Hospitals</li>
<li>Share App</li>
<li>About App</li>
<li>Report a Bug</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom Navigation holds these UI</p>
<ul>
<li>Home Screen</li>
<li>Saved CDM</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to scrap CDM of Alaska State which I will do by Sunday &amp; will send a Merge Request Soon,</p>
