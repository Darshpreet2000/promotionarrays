<ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed Bug CDM not getting saved immediately after downloading</li>
</ul>
<p>This was small problem, I just need to call Saved screen bloc to refresh data</p>

<h3 id="writing-readmemd-for-app">Writing <a href="http://Readme.html">Readme.md</a> for App</h3>
<p>This is in progress, I have searched &amp; viewed a lot of readme of many open source projects to get idea about it, I will complete this readme by Sunday</p>
<h3 id="searching-on-internet-on-how-to-make-git-repo-smaller">Searching on internet on how to make Git Repo Smaller</h3>
<p>The scraper repo is very large but it doesn't contains any large file, its size is only 1 MB but on cloning we have to clone around 500 MB, it is because Git History of commit is very large. I want to discuss with mentor mua about it</p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-plan-to-do-next-week">What do I plan to do next week?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decreasing size of data scraper repository</li>
<li>Completing readme of App</li>
<li>Writing Unit Test of Home Screen, Download CDM screen, Saved CDM Screen</li>
<li>Developing &amp; discussing REST API with flask</li>
