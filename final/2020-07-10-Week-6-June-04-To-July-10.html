<h2 id="wrote-readmemd-of-scraper">Wrote <a href="http://Readme.html">Readme.md</a> of scraper</h2>
<p>I worked on <a href="http://readme.html">readme.md</a> of scraper, I wrote in detail about project &amp; then how to setup project in your system. I have written the commands which will be needed for scraping data. Then user needs to process the scraped CDM.</p>
<p>Till now I have scraped &amp; processed data of three states Alaska, Indiana, New York.</p>
<h2 id="scraped-cdm-of-california">Scraped CDM of California</h2>
<p>I made scrapy spider which gets data from this (Link) , This data is provided by California State Health Department. I have to make &quot;<a href="http://process.py">process.py</a>&quot; scripts for each hospital.</p>
<h2 id="changed-code-organisation">Changed Code Organisation</h2>
<p>Separated “<a href="http://process.py">process.py</a>” from “Data” Directory, so that user don’t need to clone large repository. I have made changes in all <a href="http://process.py">process.py</a> scripts.</p>
<h2 id="working-on-changes-suggested-by-mentor-mua">Working on changes suggested by Mentor Mua</h2>
