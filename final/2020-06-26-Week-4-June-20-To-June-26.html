<h2 id="working-on-download-cdm-tab-in-bottom-navigation">Working on Download CDM Tab in Bottom Navigation</h2>
<p>Created a new tab in bottom Navigation which will display all the hospitals in current state of user. I have used GitLab Repository API.</p>
<h3 id="small-problem">Small Problem</h3>
<p>I have faced small problem while fetching data from API, I can get maximum of 100 Hospitals data by calling API, which is the limitation of GitLab API.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>So, I have to call API as many times in App till all hospitals data is fetched, I am fetching total number of pages in first call then calling API as many times the total number of pages &amp; getting data of 100 hospitals each time.</p>
