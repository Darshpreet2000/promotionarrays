<p>This week I learned BLoC Architecture in Flutter, I understood it quickly from YouTube videos. I started implementing it in App.</p>
<p>I will try to explain first what BLOC components should do as short as possible (and as trivial as possible).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UI screen - obviously shows data to the user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BLOC (or the ViewModel) - decides HOW to display data to the user, do we make the text bold, do we show the error, do we go to next screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repo - decides WHAT data to display to the user (do we show the content from db, do we fetch it from API)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="working-on-home-screen-backend">Working on Home Screen Backend</h3>
<p>I have created BLoC for home screen &amp; location services, I have done the following tasks in Home screen</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fetched &amp; Displayed User Location using Geolocator Package
App will ask for location permission &amp; will access location of user, I have used two packages</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>location - For asking GPS Permission</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GeoLocator - For Getting coordinates of user location</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fetched Nearby Hospitals using Overpass API</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Used Overpass API for Getting Nearby Hospitals, I have to pass Location Coordinates &amp; radius to get hospitals around my          Location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then I Parsed JSoN data recieved to list of objects</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fetching Image of each hospital from Google</p>
<ul>
<li>For fetching images, I have Used FutureBuilder Widget in flutter which executes a function which searches on Google by          Hospital name &amp; fetches the HTML Response, Then I get the link of first image &amp; pass it to another widget Cached Netwrok        Image which loads the image.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Shimmer Loading Effect to load list</p>
<ul>
<li>I have use flutter shimmer package for doing this, I have created a ListTile for this, While the data is Loading I display      this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
