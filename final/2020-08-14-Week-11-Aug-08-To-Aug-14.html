<h3 id="decreased-size-of-scraper-repository">Decreased size of scraper repository</h3>
<p>I reduced the repository size from 600 MB to around 14 MB using <a href="https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/">BFG Repo Cleaner</a>, it is a tool which cleans large blobs in git repository commits, I ran it to clear all blobs greater than 10 Kb &amp; then I achieved 14 MB size, Well it is not the original size but a lot better than previous one.</p>
