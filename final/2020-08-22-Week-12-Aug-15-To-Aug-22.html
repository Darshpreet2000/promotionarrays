<h3 id="making-compare-by-price-feature">Making Compare by price feature</h3>
<p>My Mentor Mua suggested this feature, it is very useful, we just enter price &amp; all the procedures whose price is approximate to that entered price gets displayed.</p>

<h3 id="created-option-in-app-settings-to-choose-any-location-of-us-to-try-app">Created option in App settings to choose any location of US to try App.</h3>
<p>I displayed an alert dialog when user presses on button choose a US state, then it displays all US states, when user presses any state then the app takes it as a new location &amp; fetches nearby hospital when user presses on Save button.
This feature I created for those who want to test this app and are not a resident of US.</p>
