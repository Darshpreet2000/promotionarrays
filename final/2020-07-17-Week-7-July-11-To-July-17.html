<h2 id="showing-progress-indicator-while-downloading-cdm">Showing Progress Indicator while downloading CDM</h2>
<p>The progress indicator shows percent 0-60 for downloading CDM, Rest of 60-100 percent are used for inserting downloaded large CSV to
SQL Database in App</p>
<p>This task was really challenging for me, it involves a lot of state change &amp; also I first have to get original file size using GitLab API.</p>
<p>I have used BLoC Architecture properly for handling states of progress indicator.</p>
<p>Color of progress indicator change from red-orange-green.</p>

<h2 id="working-on-gitlab-ci-pipeline">Working on Gitlab CI Pipeline</h2>
<p>I was able to successfully install chromedriver &amp; chromebrowser on Linux CI, but it was not working earlier because there was no display in CI terminal for bowser to display, I was getting an excaption, After searching a lot on StackOverFlow , I found a solution to use pyvirtualdisplay &amp; now it is working correctly.</p>
<p>The CI Pipeline Scraps CDM &amp; make a &quot;Data&quot; directory which contains CDM &amp; after running &quot;<a href="http://process.py">process.py</a>&quot; it makes &quot;CDM&quot; directory which contains CDM in proper columns.</p>
<h2 id="making-process-scripts-for-california-hospitals">Making Process Scripts for California Hospitals</h2>
<p>There are around 370 hospitals in california, Till now I have completed process script of around 250 Hospitals, for rest work I will surely complete by tomorrow.</p>
<p>This task is very time consuming &amp; also boring, I have to check column names, rows to skip in each CDM.</p>
<p>I will create its MR by tomorrow.</p>
<h2 id="view-cdm-statewise-screen">View CDM Statewise Screen</h2>
<p>This task is pending from last week, I will complete it in this weekend , I just have to get available states using Gitlab API, &amp; then show the data in list view, Opening each state will work as &quot;View CDM Screen&quot; which is already created.
So, this will done by tomorrow.</p>
